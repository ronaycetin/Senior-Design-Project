<p>
Abstract
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is a severe disease and it is the most common type of childhood leukemia. T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia occurs in the malignant transformation of T-cells in the thymus and approximately 15-18% of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients belong to T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Several genes that are involved in T-cell development have relations with many pathways that have important roles in leukemogenesis. We have identified the expression levels of p53, BAX, and BCL2. We studied 30 T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia childhood patients with quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. p53, tumor suppressor gene, and BAX are pro-apoptotic genes while BCL2 inhibits apoptosis. p53 was found to be significantly upregulated in patient samples when compared with control thymocytes. Upregulation of p53 might lead the cells to malignant transformation.</p>
